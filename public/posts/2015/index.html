<p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a great while, but I figured I would at the end / start of the year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being a bumpy ride in the last 2 years. I missed writing a yearly retrospective last year, so I really had to do it for this one.</p>
<p>Ok, here it goes. (btw, I won&rsquo;t name drop)</p>
<h1 id="major-points-in-the-year">Major points in the year:</h1>
<h2 id="writing-book-reviews">Writing book reviews</h2>
<p>Book reviewing has been a habit of mine that started on a whim.</p>
<p>Looking back into 2014, when I started reviewing books and 2 years later,</p>
<p>I can say that this has been one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Book reviewing gives me the opportunity in a rather serious manner, to give feedback to authors&rsquo; and help other people pick a better read.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I review mostly (90%) technical books. I just can&rsquo;t read a non-technical book anymore.</p>
<p>To anyone wanting to pick a good habbit - start reviewing books. Goodreads is a good platform for that.</p>
<p>To anyone reviewing books longer than me wondering why Goodreas over Amazon - Goodreads gives me a more structured and focused on book reviewing approach.</p>
<p>Also you&rsquo;ll definitely receive recognition for your reviews at some point. For me this happened after 2 years. But as the Johnie Walker ad goes - &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll reach further as long as you have fun on the way.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Make sure you enjoy it! :)</p>
<h2 id="met-wonderful-colleagues-in-a-new-job">Met wonderful colleagues in a new job</h2>
<p>March I started a new job. 2nd/3rd job of mine where I was actively part of a great team that developed web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>I learnt a lot about Agile development, team work, what it means to be reliable and how social and fun a company can be.</p>
<p>And the time passed faster than I could ever imagine. :)</p>
<p>Yet, in the fall the job started to become a run, not a marathon. The client was under pressure and it started to reflect
on the tech team. At that point my hair started to fal while I barely made 21 years in September. I knew that this wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be.</p>
<p>While I loved the team at that job and still do, I started to look for new opportunies and found a new home in the new job.
And after a stay of 9 months, I changed the job. Move on to next section.</p>
<h2 id="met-wonderful-colleagues-in-a-new-job-again">Met wonderful colleagues in a new job, again</h2>
<p>The new job revolves around developing a forex trading platform. The platform is mature but there&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>The problems that need to be solved are varying in difficulty and time. The team just recently started growing and there are workflow-based problems that need to be solved.</p>
<p>This is probably the best place to work at if you want to actually prove you are a problem-solver. Yet I feel like I&rsquo;m under-performing
as I&rsquo;m currently closing a period where I had one of the worst time management and efficiency in the past year. I hadn&rsquo;t been able to complete and review
a book for one whole month at a time. While I did definitely reach 50% and more of more than 1 book, I didn&rsquo;t commit till the end.</p>
<p>However, as the new year comes with new resolutions, this is to change. If nothing good comes out of the resolutions - at least you have the motivation in
the first two months. :D But we all know motivation comes and goes. It&rsquo;s the habbit that stays and keeps you running.</p>
<h2 id="spoke-at-a-tech-conference-to-1000-people">Spoke at a tech conference to 1000 people</h2>
<p>This also happened on a whim where I thought - what could possibly go right if I spoke at a tech conference even though</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done it before and I&rsquo;m not a natural talent to begin with.</p>
<p>Turns out the talk about &ldquo;Open-source contributing&rdquo; was delivered by me better than expected.</p>
<p>I met new people and had fun at the conference. Huge props for the organizers for giving me the chance!</p>
<h1 id="minor-points">Minor points:</h1>
<h2 id="no-rest-for-the-wicked---contributing-ever-more">No rest for the wicked - contributing ever more</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m only happy when it rains.. wait, what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy when I contribute to open source projects and make a change.</p>
<p>In 2015 I submitted some good PRs to ubuntu-make, but in the fall I started slacking big time</p>
<p>and even switched to Ruby. While I think Ruby has more flaws than Python language-wise excluding tooling and eco-system,</p>
<p>I contribute a bit more in Ruby now and try to be useful here and there with JS.</p>
<p>For the life of mine I can&rsquo;t start something useful by myself. I&rsquo;ll be eternally &ldquo;envious&rdquo; (proud) of the people who</p>
<p>are able to recognize a problem in a language&rsquo;s community and bring out a tool to solve it. It needs a lot of experience,</p>
<p>nerves and will to make something usable out of it.</p>
<h2 id="imposter-syndrome">Imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>As time goes, people&rsquo;s expectations grow and the burden gets heavier.</p>
<p>While my goals aren&rsquo;t easy to begin with, I suffered from imposter syndrome a lot this year.</p>
<p>At points I felt I was absolutely bad and unable to solve problems while I was ctually receiving praise for my performance.</p>
<p>One thing is certain - my opinion of my performance is mixed. I always aim for the top, but fall short.</p>
<p>If I could wish to straighten one thing out in the 2016, it&rsquo;s to focus on less things and excell at them.</p>
<p>I reach new levels where I&rsquo;m surrounded with amazing people. Being subpar isn&rsquo;t an option.</p>
<h2 id="spacemacs-evil-emacs-user">Spacemacs (Evil Emacs) user</h2>
<p>Finnaly I joined the master race! Jokes aside, Emacs and Vim were always on my radar,</p>
<p>but I never had enough drive to make the change.</p>
<p>Well in the fall I finally changed. Spacemacs hit all the right spots.</p>
<p>It had everything I needed to start using Emacs and Vim at the same time.</p>
<p>Leaving behind Sublime Text and Atom is a big plus for me.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m comfortable in Spacemacs yet, I definitely get more out of it than Atom could ever gi</p>
<p>For anyone wondering, I&rsquo;m using Spacemacs in Evil mode (Vim mode).</p>
<p>I honestly think modal editing is a better fit for me, but the Emacs toolset impressed me more.</p>
<p>Learning Lisp is one of my goals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Seasons die one after another</p>
