&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Well-Grounded Rubyist, 2nd edition is a great read for every aspiring Ruby developer. Not flawless, but a book that may teach you a great deal of how Ruby works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a great fountain of knowledge so to say. Reading and understanding everything may take a good while, so I&amp;rsquo;ve added a &lt;code&gt;Must-read content&lt;/code&gt; section with content that is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; not your ordinary &lt;code&gt;learn Ruby tutorial information&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: Team Geek</title>

&lt;p&gt;Team Geek is a perfect read for every software engineer, no matter whether working in a big or small company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book revolves around authors&amp;rsquo; careers as a software developers and later as a team leads/managers. As the authors&amp;rsquo; careers, the book also progresses from team work to managing people (a lot on that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may disagree with this book&amp;rsquo;s title since it says it&amp;rsquo;s focused on a software developer&amp;rsquo;s point of view, but actually focus a lot more on managers, but is that a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: How Linux Works 2nd Edition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/review-how-linux-works-2nd-edition/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593275679.do&#34;&gt;How Linux Works, 2nd Edition, What Every Superuser Should Know&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/1403&#34;&gt;Brian Ward&lt;/a&gt;, is a brilliant introductionary to advanced level, book for people who want to understand Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a enthusiast, student, employeed software developer or sys admin - this book will do you good. As a software developer, I loved the shell scripting and networking chapters. I learnt a lot in a well organized way and know what else to read, since through the chapters, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a lot of paragraphs where the author recommends books that will help you learn more about the topic(s).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: Introducing Python</title>

&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028659.do&#34;&gt;Introducing Python&lt;/a&gt; by Bill Lubavonic, is mix between an introductionary book and a cookbook. But does it find the perfect balance? It certainly  does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the description, the book is appropriate for beginning programmers, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the case. If you begin your programming journey, stop now, head to the Head First series. This is not a book for beginning programmers. You&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself googling more than reading, because the materials are harder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: Unix Haters Handbook</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/review-unix-haters-handbook/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/UNIX-HATERS_Handbook_cover_ISBN_1-56884-203-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;UHH cover&#34; title=&#34;UHH cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unix Haters Handbook is a rather interesting compilation of messages and issues with the Unix operating system, edited by Simson Garfinkel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this now, in 2014, is really refreshing. You see a lot of Unix problems explained in details, most of which are just pure hate, but anyway it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat accurate. The author really gave his best to reach the Guinness Record for most emails quoted in a book. I think he might&amp;rsquo;ve won!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: The Pomodoro Technique</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/review-the-pomodoro-technique/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pomodorotechnique.com/wp-content/themes/pomodoro/img/photos/book-phototop1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pomodoro Technique cover&#34; title=&#34;Pomodoro Technique cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://pomodorotechnique.com/book/&#34;&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt; is a book by Francesco Cirillo, who inventend the technique in the late 1980s, during his university years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the book is all about the Pomodoro technique, but what exactly is the Pomodoro Technique? The technique is all about time-management, efficiency, self-reflection and fun. Yes, fun&amp;hellip; but self-reflection? You&amp;rsquo;ll see what I mean in the following paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, what caught my eye is how easy is to get started and yet how much advanced tracking and recording you can do by mastering the technique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593274078.do&#34;&gt;Python for Kids&lt;/a&gt; is a book by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hjwp&#34;&gt;Jason R. Briggs&lt;/a&gt;, a programmer since the age of eight, when he first learned BASIC on a Radio Shack TRS-80. Since then he has written software professionally as a developer and systems architect and served as Contributing Editor for Java Developer&amp;rsquo;s Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is nothing less but a joy to read for grown ups and a must read for kids. It touches upon programming in such a light, colorful and enjoyable way that it makes you wish this book was around when you were a kid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: Introducing Github</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/review-introducing-github/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920033059/lrg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Introducing Github cover&#34; title=&#34;Introducing Github cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033059.do&#34;&gt;Introducing Github&lt;/a&gt; is a book by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/6204&#34;&gt;Peter Bell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/6247&#34;&gt;Brent Beer&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/githubtraining&#34;&gt;Github Training Team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is intended to be the introduction to Github and it&amp;rsquo;s explicitly said that it&amp;rsquo;s intended for developers too, but is it really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book suffers a lot from the authors&amp;rsquo; inexperience in writing books and keeping people&amp;rsquo;s interest (in my opinion). If you&amp;rsquo;re a newcomer to Git and Github, the first thing you would like to know is how to create your own repository and start uploading your code. However you&amp;rsquo;ll learn this only in the second-to-last chapter - fifth chapter. Before that you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to View, Edit and Collaborate and that&amp;rsquo;s not going to keep someone&amp;rsquo;s interest. It&amp;rsquo;s well-known that developers care for their own code the most. Hence the other negative reviews have one complain in common - the create your own repository chapter is too late and almost neglected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review: 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know - Extended</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/review-97-things-every-programmer-should-know/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9780596809492/lrg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;97 Things Every Programmer Should Know cover&#34; title=&#34;97 Things Every Programmer Should Know cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809492.do&#34;&gt;97 Things Every Programmer Should Know&lt;/a&gt; by Kevlin Henney is a fine collection of programming essays. It combines the technical and philosophical aspect of the programming job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you dive into the book, know that if you want to learn the technical terms - you came to the wrong place. The book touches upon already learnt technical terms and looks at them from a philosophical point of view. It makes you think, question or even change your opinion about them. It&amp;rsquo;s a good read if you want to be more social about topics with fellow programmers and the style of writing is rather enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Test-Driven-Development with Python</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/review-test-driven-development-with-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920029533/lrg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TDD Python cover&#34; title=&#34;TDD Python cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029533.do#tab_03_2&#34;&gt;Test-Driven Development with Python&lt;/a&gt; is a book by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hjwp&#34;&gt;Harry J.W Percival&lt;/a&gt;, a software developer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pythonanywhere.com/&#34;&gt;PythonAnywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start of the book, we work on a &lt;strong&gt;tdd app&lt;/strong&gt;, using what I like to call, Test-Driven Learning. We learn Django by testing with Selenium and Python&amp;rsquo;s unittest module. We get to know good practices how to test and write Functional Test &amp;lsquo;stories&amp;rsquo;. The author doesn&amp;rsquo;t start right off with Django&amp;rsquo;s best practices (as in Two Scoops of Django, for example), because it&amp;rsquo;ll be extra complexity for the reader. He starts off with small chunks of code that work and gradually explains to the reader how to do things correctly and DRY.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
