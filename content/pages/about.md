![profile picture](http://i.imgur.com/dm2H6ut.jpg)

I'm a junior software developer, fan of asian culture,
and just a super tryhard guy.

I write mostly in dynamic languages - Python and JS. (and soon Ruby too)

I support the open-source movement, use Linux and contribute to open-source projects, some of which you can find in my [github
profile](https://github.com/syndbg/).


And I love to read and practice with IT books. You can see my list
[here](/books.md)

Feel free to email me about books, life, work - `anton.synd.antonov@gmail.com`
