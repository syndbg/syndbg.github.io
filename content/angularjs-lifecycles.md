## AngularJS

AngularJS is the de facto standard MVW Framework at the moment.
ReactJS may look promising, but AngularJS is still the most used.


So what really makes AngularJS that complex? Of course it took great engineering minds to create something
so powerful, yet so simple to understand once you got the basics down.


And in AngularJS the two most important concepts to understand is directives, since AngularJS is all about directives

and life cycles.


## I'll look at the `initial`, `digest` and `directive` cycles.

Understanding them is understanding Angular.
