[How Linux Works, 2nd Edition, What Every Superuser Should Know](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593275679.do) by [Brian Ward](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/1403), is a brilliant introductionary to advanced level, book for people who want to understand Linux.

Whether you're a enthusiast, student, employeed software developer or sys admin - this book will do you good. As a software developer, I loved the shell scripting and networking chapters. I learnt a lot in a well organized way and know what else to read, since through the chapters, you'll find a lot of paragraphs where the author recommends books that will help you learn more about the topic(s).

Verdict: With this book you'll learn a lot and build good foundations to deepen your knowledge in many more topics later. If you're participating in a course like [Linux Software Foundation's Introduction to Linux(LFS101x)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/LinuxFoundationX/LFS101x/2T2014/), this book will 'overteach' you (in a good way).
