The book [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809492.do) by Kevlin Henney is a fine collection of programming essays. It combines the technical and philosophical aspect of the programming job.


Before you dive into the book, know that if you want to learn the technical terms - you came to the wrong place. The book touches upon already learnt technical terms and looks at them from a philosophical point of view. It makes you think, question or even change your opinion about them. It's a good read if you want to be more social about topics with fellow programmers and the style of writing is rather enjoyable.


If you're a junior/novice developer this book may require extensive googling for the technical terms and may not be the right read for everyone. Perhaps you would like to read Robert C. Martin's [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) to up your technical knowledge.
