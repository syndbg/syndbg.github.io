<p>After many, many weeks of planning and trying, I can 'officially' start migrating away from wordpress.</p>
<p>This blog post will be updated in the following weeks.</p>
<p>P.S There are bugged posts when they were converted to markdown. They'll be fixed soon, don't worry!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, Markdown posts!&quot;</span>
</pre>
