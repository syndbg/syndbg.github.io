Slug: review-the-pomodoro-technique


The [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/book/) is a book by Francesco Cirillo, who inventend the technique in the late 1980s, during his university years.


As expected, the book is all about the Pomodoro technique, but what exactly is the Pomodoro Technique? The technique is all about time-management, efficiency, self-reflection and fun. Yes, fun... but self-reflection? You'll see what I mean in the following paragraphs.



So first, what caught my eye is how easy is to get started and yet how much advanced tracking and recording you can do by mastering the technique.


To begin, you need a mechanical kitchen timer that will tick-tock, which will help you focus better, and set it to a time (preferrably 25 minutes). During that time you need to focus only on your task and if you complete it in less than the time interval you gave yourself, review what you've done until you hear the timer ring. When the timer rang, you completed one Pomodoro. A 'currency', you can use later to track how much time you need to complete tasks.

But that's not where the honey lies, it's in the breaks! Pomodoro stresses a lot that breaks are the most important part towards being productive. If you burnout by working too much and not taking breaks, you may or may not achieve your goals for the day, but in the following days you'll do less work due to that extra work you did the previous day.

Pomodoro recommend you take 3 to 5 minutes breaks after 25 minute sessions.
And when you have 4 Pomodori, you can take a longer break 15 to 30 minutes.

But is that a rule? No, not really. You have the flexibility to make your own rules, but don't go too far. Sessions longer than 30-40 minutes are a no-brainer and will only hurt you in the long run. The book brings up statistics that show why 25 minute sessions and 5 minutes breaks are overall the best for everyone.



And templates.. oh templates. There are three types of templates - ToDos, Activities and Records.
After you understand the basics of the Pomodoro technique, start using templates.

ToDos are the tasks just for today. Activities however are long-term tasks that you know you must finish, but you decide when. They will start showing up in your daily ToDos. And at last, records. Your archive of what you've done. It's the most important part in my opinion, because there you can see how much Pomodori, you need to finish different kind of tasks and also make predictions. You estimate how much Pomodori you need for X task, you record your Real Pomodori and the difference between Estimate and Real.



But this isn't all. The book also explains how to deal with interupts and best/worst scenarios.

This means, go read the book for yourself. Again, you can find it on `pomodorotechnique.com`.
Give it a try, it'll certainly make your days much more productive!
