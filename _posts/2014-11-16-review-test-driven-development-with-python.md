[Test-Driven Development with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029533.do#tab_03_2) is a book by [Harry J.W Percival](https://github.com/hjwp), a software developer at [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).


From the start of the book, we work on a __tdd app__, using what I like to call, Test-Driven Learning. We learn Django by testing with Selenium and Python's unittest module. We get to know good practices how to test and write Functional Test 'stories'. The author doesn't start right off with Django's best practices (as in Two Scoops of Django, for example), because it'll be extra complexity for the reader. He starts off with small chunks of code that work and gradually explains to the reader how to do things correctly and DRY.

**By the end of part 1 (6 chapters)** we learnt how to test our web apps with functional and unit tests. The learning curve is scaling well.


**In part 2 (8 chapters)**, this is where the book gets harder. You learn what is the most important thing for every web developer - how to deploy, automate your deployment and some good deployment practices. You work through Fabric with really reasonable book code comments so the viewer understands it asap, else - the author links relevant information that paints the whole picture for the viewer.

**By the end of part 2** we learnt about Django's forms in the best possible manner - with a lot of tests to prove the author's points. The best Django forms tutorial you'll ever find.


**In part 3 (8 chapters)**, you get to learn the hardest to find TDD lessons - mocking, continious integration, test isolation and types of TDD tests. We start to with JS code and jQuery basics. Nothing to deep, but enough to make our tdd app a little bit fancier and get the reader going with jQuery.

**By the end of part 3**, you can practice and understand TDD. You have written meaningful tests but it doesn't have to stop there. The appendix pages give you enough info so you can test databases, explore ansible and write class-based views - everything a Django web developer needs.



After a huge relief and satisfaction, what really stood out for me is the glossary and recaps after each chapter, especially Chapter 12's recap is worth a book by itself - a very short and yet comprehensive test class with what to test in views.

The book never stopped impressing me and I would recommend it to every aspiring or even experienced TDD practicioner, Django and Python developer, I'm sure everyone could learn something new. Even people without prior Django experience.

In the end, TDD is a joy after an expert teaches you how to test correctly and make a joy out of it! Remember, Obey the Testing Goat!


Again, you can find the book in O'Reilly's - http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029533.do#tab_03_2 . Don't forget to praise the author at https://github.com/hjwp/
