<p>I wasn't very fond of Microsoft's IDE until I started writing
HTML5/CSS3. Then I kind of fell in love with the native black theme, the
IntelliSense and most importantly - the debugger for C#.<br />
So I thought, what if it's also possible to write Python code there.
Well, it is!</p>
<p>With this neat plugin called <a href="http://pytools.codeplex.com/">Python Tools for Visual Studio
2.0</a>. It was available for previous
version of the VS IDE, however since the 2013 version of VS, you can
have it a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>(Before you install Python tools)</strong></p>
<p>If you dig through the <em>New Project</em> menu, surprisingly, you'll find a
Python category and it'll suggest you to download Python Tools. You
don't even have to google it!</p>

<p>Afterwards it's a walk in the park. You download it, install it and
you're ready to go.</p>
<p>The Python category will look somewhat like this</p>

<p>Happy Python times. Good job Microsoft.</p>
<p>BUT! I have yet to fix that annoying <em>The application data folder for
Visual Studio could not be created </em>bug....  oh well. True happiness is
a rare :D</p>
