[Python for Kids](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593274078.do) is a book by [Jason R. Briggs](https://github.com/hjwp), a programmer since the age of eight, when he first learned BASIC on a Radio Shack TRS-80. Since then he has written software professionally as a developer and systems architect and served as Contributing Editor for Java Developer's Journal.


The book is nothing less but a joy to read for grown ups and a must read for kids. It touches upon programming in such a light, colorful and enjoyable way that it makes you wish this book was around when you were a kid.


The content is served in 3 parts, `1. Learning to program`, `2. Bounce!` and `3. Mr. Stick man races for the exit`.
Starting with part 1, you get to learn programming in a well-thought-out pace of average 12-15 pages per new chapter. This is the part where the author focuses the most on the Python language and basic programming concepts. The exercises are cherry-picked programming problems that don't involve too much algorithmical thinking which might scare newcomers.

However part 2 feels unfinished and badly paced. You have only two chapters, but in the end of part 1, you introduced drawing. Why would the author do that? I think it's much more appropriate to start fresh with Part 2 and  be focused only on graphics and creating your first game. This would bring part 2 and part 3 to an equal of 4 chapters each, which wouldn't make part 2 stand-out.

Part 3 is a fitting end to a programming book for kids - a bigger game project involving sprites, graphics and animations. And the afterword gives tips to the young programmers, what they should do next.

My verdict is that this book should be the introduction to programming for kids. It's a gem. It needs very little editing in part 2 and a little bit more algorithms, to be perfect for everyone starting to program.


You can find the book in [O'Reilly's store](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593274078.do) and also you might recognize the artist's touch in the book's drawings - it's Miran Lipovaƒça, author of [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). Another great book to checkout, which delves into the dark lands of functional programming with a great sense of humor (mostly) and even more drawings!
